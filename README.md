# 911-Calls-Analysis
This project is conducting a preliminary data analysis (EDA) of more than 99,000 emergency 911 calls.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Extraction of time-based features (hour, day, month)
- Categorization of emergency call types
- Heatmaps, count plots, and time-series charts

## Tech Stack
- `Python 3.8+`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `jupyter notebook`

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/911-calls-analysis.git
   cd 911-calls-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open**:
   ```bash
   911_calls_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the fundamental skills of working with data. During the analysis, I identified significant patterns, prepared convenient visualizations, and presented the results in an understandable analytical form. Working on a project helps strengthen the skills of data analysis in Python, developing functional solutions, and creating a visual story based on data.
